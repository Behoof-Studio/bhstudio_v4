# Our Task

Our task in this project was to design and develop a new version of the website for the association, so that it could be better equipped to communicate current information on the numerous activities being undertaken by them. We have prepared a new bilingual website adapted for browsing both on computers and on mobile phones, both in polish and english language. As organisation nature is non-profit it relies on donations of the people of good will. To make it easier for donors we set up accessible Donation function and trained staff with adding new content to their site. Site’s news feed was linked and mirrored with facebook’s official page timeline for easiness of access and use.
