# Our Task

Our task was to create an elegant and minimalistic website, which would include a showcase of works created on an ongoing basis. It had to be designed for browsing on a mobile devices and, regardless of the large number of photos, to remain fast and responsive. The website also includes a built-in contact form, which makes it easier for customers to connect.
