# Our Task

Our task was development of a new website that would make it easier to provide up-to-date information to parishioners. This proved to be particularly important in the era of the coronavirus epidemic, which resulted in parish life shifting to the web to such a large extent.

There is an option to add news as well as upcoming events to the website. We also helped to create the parish channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1nhvgxK0WGuGXaS7u3KkDA/).

It is worth mentioning that despite the fact that editors can change content on the website at any time through the CMS ([Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/)), the website itself is a so-called static website created using the [JAM Stack architecture](https://jamstack.org/), which makes it much safer and cheaper to maintain than a typical one created using tools such as Wordpress or Joomla.
