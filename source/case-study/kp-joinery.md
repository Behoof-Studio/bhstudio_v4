# Our Task

We’ve been briefed by customer that their website was outdated, not optimised to modern standards of internet browsers. It wasn’t responsive hence useless on mobiles and other small screen devices. Client’s preference met our suggestion about project’s type. We’ve build site from scratch to become static online business-card type. There’s no CMS access but site’s extra safe and loads fast on every platform. Optimised and responsive for every device.
