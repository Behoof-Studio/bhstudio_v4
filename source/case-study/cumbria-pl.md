# Our Task

Our task was to thoroughly rebuild the existing website, which had served the local Polish community for 10 years. Back in 2008 site was built on joomla and had to be migrated to new CMS with all historical content kept intact. After successful migration we’ve integrated social media accounts, added currency exchange feature, created organised structure of roles and privileges for article authors, content moderators and administrators. As part of this project, a new logo has also been designed.
